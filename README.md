# Ontology_Development
This repository is for development of software tool ontologies for bioNMR.  Part of the NMRbox project.
Abstract submitted to iConference 2018:

Two barriers to computational reproducibility
are the ability to record the critical metadata required for rerunning a
computation, as well as translating the semantics of the metadata so that alternate
approaches can easily be configured for verifying computational
reproducibility. We are addressing this problem in the context of biomolecular
NMR computational analysis by developing a series of linked ontologies which
define the semantics of the various software tools used by researchers for data
transformation and analysis. Â Building
from a core ontology representing the primary observational data of NMR, the
linked data approach allows for the translation of metadata in order to
configure alternate software approaches for given computational tasks. In this
paper we illustrate the utility of this with a small sample of the core
ontology as well as tool-specific semantics for two third-party software tools.
This approach to semantic mediation will help support an automated approach to
validating the reliability of computation in which the same processing workflow
is implemented with different software tools. In addition, the detailed
semantics of both the data and the processing functionalities will provide a
method for software tool classification.
